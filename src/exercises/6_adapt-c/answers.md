4. When run without `gdb`, `cat-cheri` prints:
   ```
   # ./cat-cheri /etc/hostid
   cat-cheri: write(2) failed: Bad address
   ```
   Looking at the source code, we can see there is only one call to write(2):
   ```
   # grep -R write src/exercises/adapt-c/cat
   src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:write_off(int fildes, const void *buf, ptroff_t off, size_t nbyte)
   src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:    return (write(fildes, (const void *)(off + (uintptr_t)buf), nbyte));
   src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:                    if ((nw = write_off(wfd, buf, off, (size_t)nr)) < 0)
   src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:                            err(1, "write(2) failed");
   ```
   The call is in the `write_off()` function and the message with the error is
   printed in case the call fails. Let's see what are arguments and result
   values for the system call by setting a breakpoint for `write()` in `gdb`:
   ```
   # gdb ./cat-cheri
   (...)
   (gdb) b write
   Function "write" not defined.
   Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y
   Breakpoint 1 (write) pending.
   (gdb) r /etc/hostid
   Starting program: /root/cat-cheri /etc/hostid

   Breakpoint 1, write (fd=<optimized out>, buf=<optimized out>, nbytes=<optimized out>) at /usr/home/john/work/cheri/git/cheribsd/lib/libc/sys/write.c:48
   48                  __libc_interposing[INTERPOS_write])(fd, buf, nbytes));
   ```
   Even though the debugger believes that the function arguments are
   optimized out, from the CHERI-RISC-V calling conventions we know that
   the arguments are in the ca0, ca1, and ca2 registers:
   ```
   (gdb) info registers ca0 ca1 ca2
   ca0            0x1      0x1
   ca1            0x40802000       0x40802000
   ca2            0x25     0x25
   (gdb) disassemble 
   Dump of assembler code for function write:
   => 0x000000004027fa98 <+0>:     auipcc  ca3,0xb7
      0x000000004027fa9c <+4>:     clc     ca3,-424(ca3)
      0x000000004027faa0 <+8>:     clc     ca5,496(ca3)
      0x000000004027faa4 <+12>:    cjr     ca5
   End of assembler dump.
   ```
   We can see that `write()` was called to write to `stdout` (`ca0`) 37 bytes
   (`ca2`) from a buffer with an untagged capability (`ca1`). The `write()` libc
   function does not include a trapping instruction but it jumps with `cjr`.
   Let's see where it jumps to:
   ```
   (gdb) ni 4
   _write () at _write.S:4
   4       _write.S: No such file or directory.
   (gdb) disassemble 
   Dump of assembler code for function _write:
   => 0x0000000040282f40 <+0>:     li      t0,4
      0x0000000040282f42 <+2>:     ecall
      0x0000000040282f46 <+6>:     bnez    t0,0x40282f4e <_write+14>
      0x0000000040282f4a <+10>:    cret
      0x0000000040282f4e <+14>:    auipcc  ct1,0xffffd
      0x0000000040282f52 <+18>:    cincoffset      ct1,ct1,-1166
      0x0000000040282f56 <+22>:    cjr     ct1
   End of assembler dump.
   ```
   `write()` jumped to `_write()`, a system call wrapper written in assembly,
   that uses the `ecall` instruction to make a system call. Let's see what is
   its result:
   ```
   (gdb) ni 2
   4       in _write.S
   (gdb) info registers ca0 ct0
   ca0            0xe      0xe
   ct0            0x1      0x1
   (gdb) 
   ```
   The `write()` system call failed as the kernel set `ct0` to `0x1` and
   returned errno `0xe` in `ca0`. Looking at `errno(2)` and `write(2)`, we can
   conclude that we passed an incorrect address to the buffer.  It is likely
   here because the capability is just the address, without a tag.


5. When compiling `cat-cheri`, the compiler printed:
   ```
   ./src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:70:43: warning: binary expression on capability types 'ptroff_t' (aka 'unsigned __intcap') and 'uintptr_t' (aka 'unsigned __intcap'); it is not clear which should be used as the source of provenance; currently provenance is inherited from the left-hand side [-Wcheri-provenance]
           return (write(fildes, (const void *)(off + (uintptr_t)buf), nbyte));
                                                ~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ```
   As the [CHERI C/C++ Programming Guide](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-947.pdf)
   says in Section 4.2.3:
   > In the CHERI memory protection model, capabilities are derived from
   a single other capability.

   In our case, `off + (uintptr_t)buf` resulted in an untagged capability
   because `off` holds an integer value in an untagged capability and, as the
   compiler warns, it is used to create a resulting capability.
   In order to create a capability using the correct source capability, we can
   tell the compiler that `off` does not hold a valid address with a cast:
   ```
   diff --git a/src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c b/src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c

   ```
   `gdb` says that `cs4` triggered a CHERI exception:
   ```
   (gdb) info register cs4
   cs4            0x403545d0       0x403545d0
   ```
   `cs4` holds an untagged capability and the program tries to load a word using
   `cs4` which violates CHERI restrictions:
   ```
   (gdb) disassemble $pcc,+4
   Dump of assembler code from 0x102f7e to 0x102f82:
   => 0x0000000000102f7e <do_cat+294>:     clw     a0,16(cs4)
   End of assembler dump.
   ```
   Looking at the values of local variables, we can see that `cs4` holds the
   value of the `fp` variable:
   ```
   (gdb) info locals
   fp = 0x403545d0
   gobble = 0
   line = 0
   prev = 10
   ch = <optimized out>
   wch = <optimized out>
   ```
   It means that for some reason `fp` holds an invalid (NULL-derived)
   capability.


7. When compiling `cat-cheri`, the compiler printed:
   ```
   ./src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:80:7: warning: cast from provenance-free integer type to pointer type will give pointer that can not be dereferenced [-Wcheri-capability-misuse]
           fp = (FILE *)file;
                ^
   ```
   As the [CHERI C/C++ Programming Guide](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-947.pdf)
   says in Section 4.2:
   > (...) only pointers implemented using valid capabilities can be dereferenced.
   
   and in Section 4.2.1:
   
   > `int`,`int32_t`,`long`,`int64_t`,... These pure integer types should be
   used to hold integer values that will never be cast to a pointer type without
   first combining them with another pointer value â€“ e.g., by using them as an
   array offset.
   
   In our case, `long` is cast to a pointer type which results in a NULL-derived
   capability without a tag, with an address set to an integer value, and which
   cannot be dereferenced.  We can fix this bug by using a data type that can
   hold both integer values and pointers - `uintptr_t`:
   ```

8. The first bug resulted in a system call error because there was no capability
   operation on an invalid capability. The operating system could not copy memory
   from the user address space because it checked if a user process passed an
   invalid capability and returned an error.

   The second bug resulted in a CHERI exception because an invalid capability
   was used to load a word from memory.

and errors, we recommend to read the
