4. When run without `gdb`, `cat-cheri` prints:
   ```
   # ./cat-cheri /etc/hostid
   cat-cheri: write(2) failed: Bad address
   ```
   Looking at the source code, we can see there is only one call to write(2):
   ```
   # grep -R write src/exercises/adapt-c/cat
   src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:write_off(int fildes, const void *buf, ptroff_t off, size_t nbyte)
   src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:    return (write(fildes, (const void *)(off + (uintptr_t)buf), nbyte));
   src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:                    if ((nw = write_off(wfd, buf, off, (size_t)nr)) < 0)
   src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:                            err(1, "write(2) failed");
   ```
   The call is in the `write_off()` function and the message with the error is
   printed in case the call fails. Let's see what are arguments and result
   values for the system call by setting a breakpoint for `write()` in `gdb`:
   ```
   # gdb ./cat-cheri
   (...)
   (gdb) b write
   Function "write" not defined.
   Make breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y
   Breakpoint 1 (write) pending.

   End of assembler dump.
   (gdb) 
   ```
   We can see that `write()` was called to write to `stdout` (`ca0`) 37 bytes
   (`ca2`) from a buffer with an untagged capability (`ca1`). The `write()` libc
   function does not include a trapping instruction but it jumps with `cjr`.
   Let's see where it jumps to:
   ```
   (gdb) ni 4
   _write () at _write.S:4
   4       _write.S: No such file or directory.
   (gdb) disassemble 
   Dump of assembler code for function _write:

      0x0000000040299146 <+22>:      cjr     ct1
   End of assembler dump.
   (gdb) 
   ```
   `write()` jumped to `_write()`, a system call wrapper written in assembly,
   that makes a trap. Let's see what is a result of the system call:
   ```
   (gdb) ni 2
   4       in _write.S
   (gdb) info register ca0
   ca0            0xe      0xe
   (gdb) 
   ```
   The `write()` system call returned `0xe`. Looking at `errno(2)` and
   `write(2)`, we can conclude that we passed an incorrect address to the buffer
   which should be tagged.


5. When compiling `cat-cheri`, the compiler printed:
   ```
   ./src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:70:43: warning: binary expression on capability types 'ptroff_t' (aka 'unsigned __intcap') and 'uintptr_t' (aka 'unsigned __intcap'); it is not clear which should be used as the source of provenance; currently provenance is inherited from the left-hand side [-Wcheri-provenance]
           return (write(fildes, (const void *)(off + (uintptr_t)buf), nbyte));
                                                ~~~ ^ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ```
   As the [CHERI C/C++ Programming Guide](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-947.pdf)
   says in Section 4.2.3:
   > In the CHERI memory protection model, capabilities are derived from
   a single other capability.

   In our case, `off + (uintptr_t)buf` resulted in an untagged capability
   because `off` holds an integer value in an untagged capability and, as the
   compiler warns, it is used to create a resulting capability.
   In order to create a capability using the correct source capability, we can
   tell the compiler that `off` does not hold a valid address with a cast:
   ```
   diff --git a/src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c b/src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c

   ```
   `gdb` says that `cs2` triggered a CHERI exception:
   ```
   (gdb) info register cs2
   cs2            0x4037a400       0x4037a400
   (gdb) 
   ```
   `cs2` holds an untagged capability and the program tries to load a word using
   `cs2` which violates CHERI restrictions:
   ```
   (gdb) disassemble $pcc,+4
   Dump of assembler code from 0x103094 to 0x103098:
   => 0x0000000000103094 <do_cat+228>: lw      a0,16(s2)
   End of assembler dump.
   (gdb) 
   ```
   Looking at the above backtrace, we can correlate this output with the source
   code and see that `cs2` holds a value of
   the `fp` variable:
   ```
   (gdb) p fp
   $1 = (FILE *) 0x4037a400
   ```
   It means that for some reason `fp` became an invalid capability.


7. When compiling `cat-cheri`, the compiler printed:
   ```
   ./src/exercises/adapt-c/cat/methods.c:80:7: warning: cast from provenance-free integer type to pointer type will give pointer that can not be dereferenced [-Wcheri-capability-misuse]
           fp = (FILE *)file;
                ^
   ```
   As the [CHERI C/C++ Programming Guide](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-947.pdf)
   says in Section 4.2:
   > (...) only pointers implemented using valid capabilities can be dereferenced.
   
   and in Section 4.2.1:
   
   > `int`,`int32_t`,`long`,`int64_t`,... These pure integer types should be
   used to hold integer values that will never be cast to a pointer type without
   first combining them with another pointer value â€“ e.g., by using them as an
   array offset.
   
   In our case, `long` is cast to a pointer type which results in an invalid
   capability.  We can fix this bug by using a data type that can hold both
   integer values and pointers - `uintptr_t`:

8. The first bug resulted in a system call error because there was no capability
   operation on an invalid capability. An operating system could not copy memory
   from the user address space because it checked if a user process passed an
   invalid capability and returned an error.

   The second bug resulted in a CHERI exception because an invalid capability
   was used to load a word from memory.

and errors, we recommend to read the
