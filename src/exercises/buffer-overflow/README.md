# Exercise an inter-object buffer overflow

This exercise demonstrates an inter-object buffer overflow on RISC-V and
CHERI-RISC-V, and asks you to characterize and fix the bug detected by CHERI
bounds enforcement.  It also asks you to use GDB for debugging purposes.

1. Compile `buffer-overflow.c` with a RISC-V target and binary name of
   `buffer-overflow-riscv`, and with a CHERI-RISC-V target and binary
   name of `buffer-overflow-cheri`. **For this exercise, add `-G0` to your
   compiler flags** (this ensures `c` is not placed in the small data section
   away from `buffer`).

**buffer-overflow.c**
```C
{{#include buffer-overflow.c}}
```
2. Run both programs and observe the output.
3. Using GDB on the core dump: Why has the CHERI program failed?
4. Modify buffer-overflow.c to increase the buffer size from 128 bytes to
   1Mbyte + 1 byte.
5. Recompile and re-run `buffer-overflow-cheri`. Why does it no longer
   crash, even though the buffer overflow exists in the source code? Is
   the adjacent field still corrupted (i.e., has spatial safety been
   violated between allocations)?
6. Modify `buffer-overflow.c` to restore the original buffer size of 128
   bytes, and fix the bug by correcting accesses to the allocated array.
7. Recompile and run `buffer-overflow-cheri` to demonstrate that the
   program is now able to continue.

## Support code

**main-asserts.inc**
