# Compile and run RISC-V and CHERI-RISC-V programs

This exercise steps a participant through getting up and running
with code compilation and execution for RISC-V and CHERI-RISC-V
programs.

The first test program is written in conventional C, and can be compiled to RISC-V or CHERI-RISC-V targets:
1. Compile `print-pointer.c` with a RISC-V target and a binary name of `print-pointer-riscv`.
**print-pointer.c:**
```C
{{#include print-pointer.c}}
```
<!-- Include command line here or reference somewhere else? -->
2. Run the binary: it should print a pointer size of `8` and an address size of `8`.
3. Compile `print-pointer.c` with a CHERI-RISC-V target and a binary name of `print-pointer-cheri`.
4. Run the binary: it should print a pointer size of `16` and address size of `8`.
The second test program is written in CHERI C:
5. Compile print-capability.c with a CHERI-RISC-V target and a binary name of `print-capability`.
```C
{{#include print-capability.c}}
```
6. Run the binary: it should print a capability length of `4` (`sizeof(int)`).
7. Modify `print-capability.c` to point the capability at a pointer instead of an integer, and recompile.
8. Run the binary: it should print out a capability length of `16` (`sizeof(void*)`).
