# Introduction

This set of exercises and adversarial missions is intended to:

- Build a baseline skillset with RISC-V and CHERI-RISC-V, as well as awareness of some of the dynamics of CHERI-enabled software, through skills development exercises.
- Develop adversarial experience with CHERI-RISC-V performing basic investigation around gradations of CHERI feature deployment through focused adversarial missions.

These activities necessarily seek to supplement existing experience
with reverse engineering and exploitation on conventional architectures
and software stacks.

## Skills development exercises

**Skills development exercises** are intended to take 1-2 hours each,
and ask participants to build and perform minor modifications to simple
RISC-V and CHERI-RISC-V C/C++ programs. These exercises will encourage
participants to extend their skills to include compiling, executing,
and debugging RISC-V and CHERI-RISC-V programs, as well as basic
understanding of CHERI C/C++ properties. We highlight some key edge
cases in CHERI, including the effects of bounds imprecision, subobject
bounds, and weaker temporal safety.

These exercises take for granted a strong existing understanding of:
- The C/C++ languages
- UNIX program compilation, execution, and debugging
- RISC ISAs and binary structures/reverse engineering (e.g., on MIPS or ARMv8)

## Focused adversarial missions
**Focused adversarial missions** are intended to take
1-3 days, and ask participants to exploit, first on RISC-V, and
then on CHERI-RISC-V, documented vulnerabilities in simple "potted"
C/C++-language programs provided by the CHERI-RISC-V team. These
missions oblige participants to engage more specifically with RISC-V
exploitation, and CHERI's security objectives and mechanisms.

**These will take for granted good existing experience with
memory-safety-related attack techniques, such as buffer overflows,
integer-pointer type confusion, Return-Oriented Programming (ROP), and
Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP).**

Successful exploitation by the participant will depend only upon
widely published understanding and techniques (e.g., buffer overflows
combined with ROP). For those familiar with conventional low-level
attack techniques, this will also act as a warm-up exercise on the
baseline RISC-V architecture and expand experience with RISC-V reverse
engineering and exploitation.

The CHERI-RISC-V team will confirm exploitability for the RISC-V binary
in advance. A participant who is unable to complete the baseline
RISC-V attack is unlikely to be effective in similar work targeting
CHERI-RISC-V.
