# Inspecting CHERI Programs

Even though we can compile and run CHERI programs, we are in a position to
*inspect* and *debug* their execution.  This section documents several
techniques, including [dumping the text of an existing
binary](./inspect-disassemble.mdwith-llvm-objdump) and [using gdb to step
through a running program](./inspect-debug.md).  Feel free to treat this section
as reference material, and you are welcome to read it before diving in to the
[exercises](../exercises) or [missions](../missions), but, if you are reading
this book in order, we recommended that you skip this section the first time
through until explicitly told to read it with more context.
